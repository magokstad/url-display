# URL Display (VERY WIP)

Hallo

URL Display is a browser extension that briefly displays the current hostname on
top of the current tab. This extension is currently a work in progress and is
being actively developed.

### Why does this extension exist?

The creator of this extension runs a fullscreen Librewolf browser with a hidden
topbar (achieved with editing userChrome.css) and uses Tridactyl to move around.
While this setup looks clean, it can be difficult to see the URL of the current
tab. This extension was created to briefly display the current hostname on top
of the current tab, making it easier to see the URL without cluttering the
interface.

### How to use this extension

To use this extension, simply install it in your browser (Mozilla store WIP) and it will start
working automatically. When you switch to a new tab, the current hostname will
be briefly displayed on top of the tab. The display time can be customized in
the extension settings (WIP).
